Use the env var API_PROXY_TARGET to change this. You can create multiple .env files in the ui/ directory for different environments or configurations. For example, use yarn start --mode staging to load .env.staging and point the API_PROXY_TARGET to a remote backend. Installation Note: if you installed the ui using Docker first (as instructed in the quick-start) then your local node_modules/ directory will be owned by root. Change the permissions with: sudo chown -R ${UID}:${UID} ui/node_modules . The version of Node on your host machine must match that of the Docker container (which will be the case if you follow the nvm instructions below.) # Enter into the ui directory cd ui # Install Node Version Manager curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash # Install required Node.js version nvm install # Install Yarn dependencies yarn install # Start the frontend yarn start Visit http://localhost:3000/ Backend Dependencies Docker Docker Compose All backend packages are installed in the docker containers, however for faster auto-completion and intellisense, you can install them on the host machine: python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements/local.txt Helpful Commands Run the docker compose stack in the background docker compose up -d Watch the logs of Django & the backend workers docker compose logs -f django celeryworker Watch the logs of all services: docker compose logs -f Create a super user account: docker compose run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser Create a fresh demo project with synthetic data docker compose run --rm django python manage.py create_demo_project Run tests docker compose run --rm django python manage.py test Run tests with a specific pattern in the test name docker compose run --rm django python manage.py test -k pattern Run tests and drop into interactive shell on failure docker compose run --rm django python manage.py test -k pattern --failfast --pdb Speed up development of tests by reusing the db between test runs docker compose run --rm django python manage.py test --keepdb Run management scripts docker compose run django python manage.py --help Launch the Django shell: docker compose exec django python manage.py shell >>> from ami.main.models import SourceImage, Occurrence >>> SourceImage.objects.all(project__name='myproject') Install backend dependencies locally for IDE support (Intellisense, etc): python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements/local.txt Generate OpenAPI schema docker compose run --rm django python manage.py spectacular --api-version 'api' --format openapi --file ami-openapi-schema.yaml Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI schema docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i /local/ami-openapi-schema.yaml -g typescript-axios -o /local/ui/src/api-schema.d.ts Generate diagram graph of Django models & relationships (Graphviz required) docker compose run --rm django python manage.py graph_models -a -o models.dot --dot dot -Tsvg models.dot > models.svg Project Data Storage Each project manages its own external data storage where the AMI Platform will index and process images. This is most typically a public or private S3 bucket at a cloud provider that is not AWS. For example, the Swift object storage service at Compute Canada or a university's own storage service. To test the S3 storage backend locally, Minio is configured to run as part of the docker compose stack. To configure a project connect to the Minio service, you can use the following config: Endpoint URL: http://minio:9000 Access key: amistorage Secret access key: amistorage Public base URL: http://minio:9000/ami/ Bucket: ami Open the Minio web interface at http://localhost:9001 and login with the access key and secret access key. Upload some test images to a subfolder in the ami bucket (one subfolder per deployment) Give the bucket or folder anonymous access using the \"Anonymous access\" button in the Minio web interface. Both public and private buckets with presigned URLs should work. Add entries to your local /etc/hosts file to map the minio and django hostnames to localhost so the same image URLs can be viewed in your host machine's browser and processed in the backend containers. 127.0.0.1 minio 127.0.0.1 django Email The local environment uses the console email backend. To view emails sent by the platform, check the console output (run the docker compose logs -f django celeryworker command).
